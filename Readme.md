Passing through the fireship

## Pocketbase to handle the Database

Run it with

```sh
./pocketbase/pocketbase serve
```

## General notice

The course is a very fast pace welcome introduction to NextJS, it ommits a lot of deep dives and has no
proper code examples whcih can be forked and to be runned.

Also, its done tightly on `vercel` setup, which is DX friendly but very costly for business. Using a Vercel KV storage or similar, is good for a proof of concept but in the end, that one is a very costly endevour! Pay attention to the budget and the probable load of the product.

Some rules of thumbs:

1. NextJS + Vercel to kickstart an idea
2. Have the marketing to perform possible growth of the product
3. Reimplement to better cloud with per-cost payment, which should be cheeper than Vercel plans areâ€¦
